// Package villa contains some helper data structures: priority queue(interface{} and int as elements), array list(with sort interface and binary search supporting).
//
// By using array-list related structs, some mutable list can be easily maintained. Sort and binary-search algorithm can be easily imposed(with a custemizable comparator function).
//
// The priority queue related structs provides a ready to use interface instead of the standard interface.
