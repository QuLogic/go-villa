/*
Package villa contains some helper data structures: priority queue(interface{}
and int as elements), slice wrapper(interface{}, int, float and complex as elements),
Sort, binary search and merge with customized comparator.

By using Slice, IntSlice, FloatSlice or ComplexSlice types, some mutable list can be easily maintained.

The priority queue related structs provides a ready to use interface instead of the standard interface.
